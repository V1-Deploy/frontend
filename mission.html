                <p>Cheating has become one of the most persistent challenges in modern gaming. Over the past decade, competitive and casual players alike have watched trust erode as exploits, hacks, glitches, and other unfair advantages increasingly affect online experiences. While game developers work tirelessly to combat these issues, permanent enforcement is complex, time-consuming, and often limited by technical and legal constraints. As a result, many legitimate players are left questioning the integrity of the players they face.</p>
                
                <p>Our mission is not to declare guilt, determine intent, or act as an authority on whether any individual is cheating. Instead, our goal is to provide a transparent, community-driven platform where players can document and share observed behavior that may help players gain an understanding of their opponents' tendencies. This platform exists to empower players with information, context, and collective insight, not accusations or verdicts.</p>
                
                <p>We believe accountability begins with visibility and transparency. By allowing the community to contribute reports, we aim to create a reliable record of patterns and behaviors over time. A single report proves nothing; consistent trends, supported by multiple perspectives, help paint a clearer picture. Our platform encourages responsible reporting, thoughtful discussion, and critical evaluation rather than emotional reactions or witch hunts.</p>
                
                <p>This website is designed to supplement, not replace, official anti-cheat systems and moderation tools. It is a resource for players seeking clarity and awareness at a time when gaming experiences have never felt more un-natural. Whether questioning a suspicious encounter or researching a player's history, our goal is to provide context without judgment.</p>
                
                <p>Ultimately, we strive to restore trust within gaming communities by fostering collaboration, transparency, and shared responsibility. Fair play matters, and as the players, it's OUR SHARED RESPONSIBILITY to help uphold it.</p>
