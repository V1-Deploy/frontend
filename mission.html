                <p>Cheating has become one of the most persistent challenges in modern gaming. Over the past decade, competitive and casual players alike have watched trust erode as exploits, hacks, glitches, and other unfair advantages increasingly affect online experiences. While game developers work tirelessly to combat these issues, permanent enforcement is complex, time-consuming, and often limited by technical and legal constraints. As a result, many legitimate players are left questioning the integrity of the players they face.</p>
                
                <p>Our mission is not to declare guilt, determine intent, or act as an authority on whether any individual is cheating. Instead, our goal is to provide a transparent, community-driven platform where players can document and share observed behavior that may help players gain an understanding of their opponents' tendencies. This platform exists to empower players with information, context, and collective insight, not accusations or verdicts.</p>
                
                <p>We believe accountability begins with visibility and transparency. By allowing the community to contribute reports, we aim to create a reliable record of patterns and behaviors over time. A single report proves nothing; consistent trends, supported by multiple perspectives, help paint a clearer picture. Our platform encourages responsible reporting, thoughtful discussion, and critical evaluation rather than emotional reactions or witch hunts.</p>
                
                <p>The information submitted to Topside Tracker is aggregated and used for meta analyses to understand broader patterns such as when reports most frequently occur, how reporting volume changes over time, and how many accounts exceed defined reporting thresholds. These analyses are intended to highlight trends rather than target individuals. We take active steps to protect against abuse including rate limiting reports and monitoring for anomalous submission behavior. Topside Tracker does not investigate players, does not determine wrongdoing, and does not make any claims or assertions of cheating. Our goal is to present anonymized trend level insights while maintaining safeguards, fairness, and respect for all players.</p>
